PyPRS uses the MRG32k3a random number generator described  in L’Ecuyer (1999) and L’Ecuyer et al. (2002). This generator has been shown to pass rigorous statistical tests and has an exceptionally long period of approximately $2^{191}$. So far, two high-quality Python-based implementations of the MRG32k3a random number generator have been developed (Cooper and Hunter 2020 and Eckman et al. 2023). PyPRS adopts the implementation from Eckman et al. (2023). In this implementation, the period is split into approximately $2^{50}$ streams of length $2^{141}$. Each stream contains $2^{47}$ substreams of length $2^{94}$, and each substream contains $2^{47}$ subsubstreams of length $2^{47}$.
