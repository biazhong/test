# The Output of PyPRS
### Output

When the procedure completes, the **Results** frame will show a `Complete solving` message. It will also provide the paths to the output files that have been saved to the `Output` folder.

## ðŸ“‘ Summary Results
The `SummaryResults.txt` file stores the Summary Results, logging the outcome of each macroreplication by specifying which alternative was ultimately selected. As mentioned, the path to this file appears in the **Results** frame upon completion.
The data within `SummaryResults.txt` is organized as follows:
- **Structure**:
  - The first part specifies the procedure that was selected.
  - The second part details the outcome of each macroreplication for the selected procedure.
    - `Best Alternative`: The parameter information for the ultimately selected alternative in this macroreplication.
    - `Total Simulation Time`: The total time spent generating simulation samples in this macroreplication.
    - `Wall-Clock Time`: The actual time taken to complete this macroreplication.
    - `Total Sample Size`: The total number of samples generated by the end of this macroreplication.
    - `Utilization`: A measure of processors efficiency in parallel computing. It represents how busy processors were, on average, while running the procedure.
      ($\text{Utilization}=\frac{\text{Total Simulation Time}}{\text{Number of Processors}\times\text{Wall-Clock Time}}$)
  - The third part presents the mean of all scalar performance outputs, based on all macroreplications (95% confidence intervals are calculated when the number of macroreplications is 10 or greater).

## ðŸ“ˆ Detailed Results
Because different procedures have different implementation logic, the **Detailed Results** that need to be recorded also differ. For this reason, PyPRS cannot provide **Detailed Results** for a user-defined Custom Procedure.

The **Detailed Results** are saved to the `DetailedResults.txt` file. Figures are then generated based on the statistical mean of the **Detailed Results** from all macroreplications. Furthermore, when the number of macroreplications is greater than or equal to 10, a 95% confidence interval is also generated. The paths to these files and figures appear in the **Results** frame upon completion.

This section will detail the Detailed Results for each built-in procedure.
### Detailed Results for GSP
For the GSP procedure, the **Detailed Results** log detailed performance measures from its three implementation stages. The specific meanings of these detailed performance measures are as follows:

- `Current Max Mean`: The maximum sample mean after completing the current stage in this macroreplication.
- `Cumulative Simulation Time (s)`: The cumulative time spent generating simulation samples after completing the current stage in this macroreplication.
- `Cumulative Sample Size`: The cumulative number of samples generated by the end of this current stage in this macroreplication.
- `Wall-Clock Time (s)`: The actural time taken from the start of the first stage to the end of the current stage in this macroreplication.
- `Number of Surviving Alternatives`: The number of remaining alternatives at the end of the current stage in this macroreplication.
- `Utilization`: A measure of processor utilization up to the end of the current stage in this macroreplication.

The file `DetailedResults.txt` contains the detailed results, which are organized by macroreplication. Within every macroreplication, the data for each stage is presented in the following order: Stage 1, Stage 2 Round 1, ..., Stage 2 Round 10, and Stage 3. The metrics displayed for each stage include: `Current Max Mean`, `Cumulative Simulation Time (s)`, `Cumulative Sample Size`, `Wall-Clock Time (s)`, `Number of Surviving Alternatives`, and `Utilization`. Refer to the example below for a specific illustration.

The `Figures` section contains six plots, each illustrating the progression of a specific metric over the various stages. These metrics are `Current Max Mean`, `Cumulative Simulation Time (s)`, `Cumulative Sample Size`, `Wall-Clock Time (s)`, `Number of Surviving Alternatives`, and `Utilization`. For each stage, the data point represents the average value and the corresponding 95% confidence interval, computed from all macroreplications at that particular stage.
