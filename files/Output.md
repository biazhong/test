# The Output of PyPRS
After successfully using a procedure in PyPRS to solve a specific problem, the results are stored locally. Currently, PyPRS generates two types of results, i.e., **summary results** and **detailed results**. 

## ðŸ“‘ Summary Results
For both built-in and custom procedures, the summary results are stored in the `SummaryResults.txt` file upon solving a problem. The data within the `SummaryResults.txt` file is organized as follows:
- **Structure**:
  - **Header**: Specifies the selected procedure.
  - **Macroreplication Details**: Records the outcomes for each macroreplication of the chosen procedure.
    - `Best Alternative`: The parameter information for the selected alternative in this macroreplication.
    - `Total Simulation Time`: Total time spent in generating simulation samples in this macroreplication.
    - `Wall-Clock Time`: Actual time required to complete this macroreplication.
    - `Total Sample Size`: Total number of samples generated by the end of this macroreplication.
    - `Utilization`: Measure of processors utilization in parallel computing. 
  - **Performance Summary**: Calculates the means of `Total Simulation Time`, `Wall-Clock Time`, `Total Sample Size`, and `Utilization` based on all macroreplications (95% confidence intervals are calculated when the number of macroreplications is 10 or greater).
- **Example Format**:
```markdown

## ðŸ“ˆ Detailed Results
For built-in procedures in PyPRS, a `DetailedResults.txt` file is generated alongside the `SummaryResults.txt` file to capture comprehensive data from each macroreplication's execution. As different procedures employ distinct selection structures, the content of the `DetailedResults.txt` file varies depending on the specific procedure. Additionally, for each built-in procedure, PyPRS generates figures to visualize the detailed results, which are saved locally as image files.

Below, we outline the contents of the `DetailedResults.txt` file for each procedure.

### GSP
We collect the following data at different time stamps during the execution of the procedure:
- `Current Max Mean`: The maximum sample mean observed.
- `Cumulative Simulation Time (s)`: The cumulative time spent in generating simulation samples.
- `Cumulative Sample Size`: The cumulative number of samples generated.
- `Wall-Clock Time (s)`: The elapsed real-world time.
- `Number of Surviving Alternatives`: The count of alternatives still under consideration.
- `Utilization`: A measure of processor utilization.

The example format of the `DetailedResults.txt` file for GSP:
```markdown
