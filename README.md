# PyPRS: A Python Software Package for Parallel Ranking and Selection Procedures



**PyPRS** is a Python software package specifically developed to solve large-scale ranking and selection (R&S) problems in parallel computing environments. The underlying parallel computing framework is **Ray**. PyPRS incorporates four well-known parallel procedures: 

- **The Good Selection Procedure (GSP)**
- **The Knockout-Tournament (KT) Procedure**
- **The Parallel Adaptive Survivor Selection (PASS) Procedure**
- **The Fixed-Budget Knockout-Tournament (FBKT) Procedure**

Users can also upload custom procedures to test and compare performance against these built-in procedures.
